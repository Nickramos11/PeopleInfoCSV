# PeopleInfoCSV
In this repository, I use python code in peoplecsvcode.py to take each persons info in the original people.csv file located in the raw_data folder and revise it to include a separate first and last name column, blur out the first 5 digits in each SSN and abbreviate each persons state. When the code is ran, the revised csv will appear in the same raw_data folder. To test this, simply open the raw_data folder, delete the revision CSV and rerun the code. The revision CSV will automatically return to the raw_data folder. You can see the differences between the two CSVs as the original will also remain.
